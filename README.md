1. For part one I used my notes from class to write out a get and post request with fetch just took a bit of adjusting

2. For part 1 of part 2 I didn't have much trouble using my notes to fetch my user information
   then for part 2 of 2 I used a for loop to iterate through the first 5 repos

the functions will log the data to the console when the site loads
